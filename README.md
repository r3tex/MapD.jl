# MapD
This Julia package is an interface to MapD (that only works on Linux/Unix) and makes use of the `mapdql` and `StreamInsert` tools. It was developed to let people conveniently send DataFrames into MapD for visualization.

Currently the following data-types are supported:

|Julia Type|MapD type|
| :--- | ---: |
|String | TEXT|
|Int16 | SMALLINT |
|Int32 | INTEGER|
|Int64 | BIGINT|
|Bool | BOOLEAN|
|Float32 | FLOAT|
|Float64 | DOUBLE|
|DateTime | TIMESTAMP|

# Example use

`mapdwrite()` will return a `UInt16` error code which you can check. 
If the returned value is `0` then you're in good shape.
You can also truncate the table before inserting new data.
If the table doesn't exist, it will be created.
If the types do not match, you will get a warning.
```
julia> using MapD, DataFrames

julia> con = MapDcon()
MapD.MapDcon("localhost", 9091, "mapd", "HyperInteractive", "mapd")

julia> err = mapdwrite(con, dataframe, "specialtable", truncate=true)
```
